/**
 * Rewrite every `SF:` path in the emitted lcov reports so it is relative to the
 * WORKSPACE root rather than to each project's own vitest root.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Vitest writes `SF:` paths relative to the config's root, so
 * `libs/mintplayer-web-components/dock/index.ts` is emitted as `dock/index.ts`.
 * The coverage service resolves report paths against `git ls-files` by longest
 * suffix — and `dock/index.ts` exists under FOUR libraries (web-components,
 * ng-bootstrap, react-bootstrap, vue-bootstrap). An ambiguous suffix cannot be
 * resolved, so the service marks the file unmatched and **excludes it from the
 * totals entirely**.
 *
 * Measured on PR #405 before this script existed: 314 of 1405 files (22.3%)
 * silently dropped — 58% of react-bootstrap and 58% of vue-bootstrap, which is
 * why those libraries reported ~66 and ~95 coverable lines for 129 and 130
 * files. The service's UI caps its "unmatched" list at 50, so the true scale
 * was invisible there.
 *
 * The mapping is exact because the coverage directory mirrors the project path:
 * `coverage/libs/mintplayer-web-components/lcov.info` <-> project
 * `libs/mintplayer-web-components`. So the prefix is just the report's own
 * directory, minus the leading `coverage/`.
 *
 * Fails loudly on a path that does not resolve on disk. Silence is how the
 * original bug survived; a project layout change should break the build rather
 * than quietly shrink the denominator again.
 *
 * Side-effect-free on import: the CLI work sits behind an isEntryPoint guard so
 * the spec can exercise the exported pieces without rewriting real reports.
