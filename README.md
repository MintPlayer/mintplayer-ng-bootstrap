# @mintplayer/ng-bootstrap
## Important notes
### 30/01/2022
Since the last version of NX, the consuming application receives the following error on build:

    âˆš Browser application bundle generation complete.
    An unhandled exception occurred: Transform failed with 1 error:
    error: Invalid version: "15.2-15.3"
    See "C:\Users\PIETER~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ng-gBqa5t\angular-errors.log" for further details.
    
For me, having the following `.browserlistrc` in the angular application fixes the error:

    last 2 Safari major versions
    last 2 iOS major versions
    Firefox ESR
    not ios_saf 15.2-15.3
    not safari 15.2-15.3

## Installation

    npm i @mintplayer/ng-bootstrap

This should also install the peerDependencies in your project.

Now you should import the `bootstrap` stylesheet in the application. To do so, you have 2 options:

Update your `angular.json`:

    "styles": [
      "node_modules/@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap/_bootstrap.scss",
      "src/styles.scss"
    ],

Or add the stylesheet in your `styles.scss`

    @import 'node_modules/@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap/_bootstrap.scss';

## Components
All components are showcased in the angular app included in the project. You can simply run

    npm start -- --open

to discover them.
