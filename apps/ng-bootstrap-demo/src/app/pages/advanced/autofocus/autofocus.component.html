<h1>Autofocus</h1>
<p>
    The autofocus (FocusOnLoad) directive is not included in this very package, but in the peerDependency <b>@mintplayer/ng-focus-on-load</b>.
    It focuses the elements (or even components that implement the <b>focus()</b> method) as soon as they appear, either through navigation or through *ngIf.

<bs-select2 (provideSuggestions)="onProvideArtistSuggestions($event)" [suggestions]="artistSuggestions" autofocus>
</bs-select2>
