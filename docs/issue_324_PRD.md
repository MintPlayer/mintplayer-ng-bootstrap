# Product Requirements Document: Dark mode + theming guidance

**Issue**: #324
**Title**: dark-mode / style customization instructions
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2026-05-13
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-13

## Overview

Ship a recommended, library-supported path for runtime color-mode switching (`auto` / `light` / `dark` / custom variants), wire it into the demo as a global toggle button, and add a documentation page that teaches consumers how to customize Bootstrap colors at both build time (SCSS) and run time (CSS variables + `data-bs-theme`).

The runtime switch mechanism is Bootstrap-native: flip `data-bs-theme` on `<html>`. The library ships `BsThemeService` to own that state, persist it, and resolve `auto` via `prefers-color-scheme`. The demo wires its own icon button — the library deliberately does not impose a UI shape.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Provide an answer to the issue's open question — "what's the recommended approach to switch between Bootstrap light/dark mode at runtime?" — that compiles, ships, and is reproducible by any consumer.
- Demonstrate the answer in the demo so visitors can see and try it.
- Document customization (build-time SCSS, runtime CSS-var, custom `data-bs-theme="…"` variants) so consumers don't have to reverse-engineer the recipe.

### Success Metrics
- A new public API at `@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap/theme` with one service (`BsThemeService`), one writable mode method (`setMode`), and two readonly signals (`mode`, `effectiveMode`).
- A working three-state toggle in the demo navbar, persisting across reloads, with no light/dark flash on initial paint.
- A doc page at `/additional-samples/theming` covering all six topics listed under FR-3.
- Unit + e2e tests demonstrating service behaviour and end-to-end toggle integration.

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (P0)

- [ ] **FR-1**: New library subentry `@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap/theme` exporting `BsThemeService`, the `BsThemeMode` type (`'auto' | 'light' | 'dark' | (string & {})`), the resolved `BsEffectiveThemeMode` type, and the `BS_THEME_STORAGE_KEY` constant. Subentry follows the existing `navigation-lock` packaging pattern.
- [ ] **FR-2**: `BsThemeService` (signal-first, methods-only API):
  - `readonly mode: Signal<BsThemeMode>` — readonly view; initialised from `localStorage[BS_THEME_STORAGE_KEY]` (default `'auto'`).
  - `readonly effectiveMode: Signal<BsEffectiveThemeMode>` — computed; resolves `'auto'` via `matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`; returns the literal otherwise.
  - `setMode(m: BsThemeMode): void` — writes the writable, persists to localStorage, triggers the attribute-write effect.
  - Internal `effect()` writes `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-bs-theme', effectiveMode())` whenever the computed changes.
  - `prefers-color-scheme` `change` listener installed once, drives a private `prefersDark` signal — `effectiveMode` recomputes live when in `auto` mode.
- [ ] **FR-3**: New demo page at `/additional-samples/theming` covering, in order: (a) intro to Bootstrap 5.3 color modes, (b) build-time SCSS variable overrides with a worked example, (c) runtime CSS-variable overrides with a worked example, (d) the 3-state toggle recipe via `BsThemeService`, (e) per-component `--bs-*` variable reference table for the most commonly tweaked components, (f) authoring a custom `[data-bs-theme="sepia"]` variant, and (g) SSR / no-flash inline-script integration.
- [ ] **FR-4**: Demo right-side navbar shows a single icon button that cycles `auto → light → dark → auto`. Icon reflects current mode; `aria-label` updates accordingly. Placed before the existing GitHub link in `<bs-navbar-nav class="me-0">`.
- [ ] **FR-5**: Demo `<bs-navbar>` `[color]` binding adapts to `effectiveMode()` — light navbar in light mode, dark navbar in dark mode. Implemented via a `computed()` in `AppComponent`.
- [ ] **FR-6**: Inline pre-boot `<script>` block added to `apps/ng-bootstrap-demo/src/index.html`'s `<head>`, placed before any `<link rel="stylesheet">`. Reads localStorage + matchMedia, writes `data-bs-theme` synchronously. Prevents light-mode flash for dark-mode users on reload.
- [ ] **FR-7**: Vitest unit spec `bs-theme.service.spec.ts` covers: initial-mode reads from storage and falls back to `'auto'`; `setMode` persists and updates the signal; `effectiveMode` resolves `'auto'` correctly via both matchMedia states; explicit modes pass through; matchMedia `change` event only triggers when in `auto`; DOM attribute reflects `effectiveMode` after any change; SSR platform skips localStorage/matchMedia/DOM access.
- [ ] **FR-8**: Playwright e2e spec `theme-toggle.spec.ts` covers: pre-boot script applies persisted mode before paint; toggle cycles through `auto → light → dark → auto`; persistence across reload; body background `getComputedStyle` differs between light and dark.
- [ ] **FR-9**: New navbar dropdown link "Theming" under "Additional samples" pointing to `/additional-samples/theming`.

### Should Have (P1)

- [ ] **FR-10**: CHANGELOG entry under `[Unreleased] / Added`: "Theme service + dark-mode toggle in demo (`@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap/theme`)".
- [ ] **FR-11**: Visual regression spot-check of every existing demo page in both modes (manual). Any components that are visibly broken in either mode get a one-line note in the PR description; severe breakage gets a follow-up issue (out of scope for this PR per the BC-is-not-default feedback note — design for the cleanest end state, not a half-finished one).

### Out of Scope
- Per-component dark-mode CSS coverage gaps in the library SCSS subset (`_bootstrap.scss` imports only a partial set of Bootstrap component SCSS files; components with their own SCSS may have light/dark gaps that surface during the visual pass). Handled per-component as separate follow-up issues if any concretely break.
- Bundling the pre-boot script as a library asset (consumers' SSR setups vary too much — Angular index.html vs Next.js `_document.tsx` vs Razor partial — a documented snippet is more portable).
- A `<bs-theme-toggle>` component in the library. The demo's cycling icon button is wired locally; consumers compose their own UI.
- Theming for non-Bootstrap components in the library (custom WC styling, like `mp-scheduler` or `mp-dock`). They have their own internal `data-bs-theme` handling already (verified in ribbon WC); separate concern.

## Timeline & Milestones

### Milestone 1: Library service
- [ ] Scaffold `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/theme/` subentry.
- [ ] Implement `BsThemeService` + types + constant.

## Technical Notes (Issue-Specific)

- **Why `data-bs-theme` is the switch and `setProperty` is reserved for customization**: `bootstrap/scss/_root.scss` already emits `[data-bs-theme="dark"]` via `@include color-mode(dark, true)`. Flipping the attribute swaps the full palette atomically and inherits future Bootstrap updates for free. Re-implementing the swap in JS via per-variable `setProperty` would require enumerating every overridden var, would rot on Bootstrap upgrades, and would force us to re-derive `prefers-color-scheme` semantics in JS for "auto". `setProperty` is the right tool for *runtime customization* (brand-color picker, end-user theming) and is documented as such — not as the mode-switch primitive.
- **Why `auto` is JS-resolved, not CSS-resolved**: Bootstrap's default `$color-mode-type: data` config emits selectors only, not `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` blocks. Flipping `$color-mode-type` to `media-query` would emit the media query but lose the ability to override system preference — incompatible with a three-state toggle. JS resolution gives us one observable state (`effectiveMode`) and full control.
- **Why an inline pre-boot script in `<head>`, not a deferred module**: SSR-rendered HTML has no `data-bs-theme` attribute; without intervention, dark-mode users see a white flash before the Angular service runs. The inline script in `<head>` (before any `<link rel="stylesheet">`) reads localStorage + matchMedia and writes the attribute *before* the browser evaluates Bootstrap's CSS. No FOUC. The technique is what Bootstrap's own docs, GitHub, and MDN all use.
- **Drift risk between inline script and service**: both read the same localStorage key (`BS_THEME_STORAGE_KEY`) and the same matchMedia query, but the inline script is hand-written JS (can't import the constant — it runs before any module loads). Mitigation: the constant lives in `bs-theme-mode.ts` with a comment pointing to the script; the doc page shows the script with the literal key inlined.
- **Custom variant type**: `BsThemeMode = 'auto' | 'light' | 'dark' | (string & {})` — the `(string & {})` trick preserves autocomplete for known values while accepting arbitrary strings without an `as` cast. `effectiveMode` widens to `BsEffectiveThemeMode = 'light' | 'dark' | (string & {})` because `'auto'` is always resolved.
- **Navbar light-mode contrast unknown**: the demo currently uses `[color]="colors.dark"` always. The first time `colors.light` is rendered in this navbar, it may have insufficient contrast (text or links wash out) given the library's partial SCSS imports. If that's the case during the implementation visual pass, the fall-back is to leave the navbar dark always and document the choice — FR-5 then becomes a P1 follow-up rather than a blocker.
