# PRD: ARIA & accessibility — Lit web components (splitter, dock, scheduler, tile-manager)

**Status:** **Implemented** — all 9 phases shipped on `feat/aria-accessibility`. Axe-core CI (Phase 8.2) explicitly deferred to a follow-up issue. See per-phase ✓ markers in §7.
**Author:** Pieterjan (audit by 4-agent ARIA team)
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Library:** `@mintplayer/ng-bootstrap` web-component layer + nested WCs in `dock/` and `tile-manager/`
**Standards target:** [WAI-ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) + [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/), conformance to **WCAG 2.2 AA**.
**Companion PRDs:**
- [`aria-accessibility-audit.md`](./aria-accessibility-audit.md) — covers the Angular component layer; this PRD is the WC-layer follow-up.
- [`scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md`](./scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md) — extends/supersedes Phase 6: cell-level grid nav, range selection, Enter-driven move-mode, cross-day resize. Shipped 2026-05-10.

> **Audit findings note** — §5 below captures the scheduler / dock / splitter / tile-manager state at audit time (2026-05-10). Where a phase has shipped, the implementation supersedes the audit's "current state" rows; the rows are kept as the historical record so reviewers can trace the rationale for each fix.

---

## 1. Motivation

The Angular component layer is finishing its ARIA pass on branch `feat/aria-accessibility` (see companion PRD §1–§5). The Lit web-component layer — `mp-splitter`, `mint-dock-manager`, `mp-scheduler`, `mint-tile-manager` — was deliberately scoped out of the Angular audit because each WC needs deeper, pattern-specific work that doesn't fit in a "1-PR per Angular component" rhythm.

These four components are the most layout-driven, drag-driven, and pointer-dependent things the library ships. They're also the most likely to be reused outside Angular (per the standing rule: *new components default to a Lit WC + Angular wrapper*). If they ship inaccessible, every downstream framework adopter inherits the gap.

A library that's sold as "Bootstrap drop-in with deep components" needs each of these to clear APG conformance for its pattern. Right now they don't — three of the four have **zero ARIA** on the interactive parts, and the fourth (tile-manager, post `ca7a0c9d`) is a partial start.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**

- **G1.** Every interactive surface (gutters, dividers, tabs, drop joysticks, event blocks, tiles) is reachable, operable, and labelled for screen readers + keyboard-only users.
- **G2.** Every drag-driven interaction has a **keyboard alternative** that delivers the same outcome (per APG drag-and-drop guidance). The pattern is consistent across components: focus the item → enter *move/resize mode* → arrow keys nudge → Enter commits → Escape cancels → live region narrates each step.
- **G3.** Every state change a sighted user perceives (split resized, pane moved, event nudged, tile reflowed) is exposed to assistive tech via a polite live region. Live announcer logic is shared, not re-implemented per component.
- **G4.** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honoured for layout reflow, drag preview, and any auto-pan.
- **G5.** Each WC implements one named APG pattern fully (Window Splitter; Tabs + Window Splitter + DnD-keyboard-alt for dock; Grid for scheduler; Grid-or-Region for tile-manager) — required attributes verbatim, recommended where they meaningfully help.
- **G6.** ARIA work lives in the Lit WC, not the Angular wrapper. Wrappers stay thin.

**Non-goals**

- WCAG AAA. AA is the bar.
- Re-architecting the WCs to share a base class. Each component implements its own pattern; the only shared primitive introduced here is the live announcer (§7).
- A `BsRovingFocusDirective` inside the Lit WCs. The Angular roving-focus directive can't run there — each WC implements its own roving-focus loop, kept small and inline.
- Backwards-compatibility shims for current consumers. If a tile-manager consumer was relying on every tile being `tabindex="0"`, they get the new roving-focus model after this lands. Document, don't shim. (See memory: *BC is not a default constraint*.)

## 3. Scope

**In scope:**

- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/web-components/splitter/` — `mp-splitter`
- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/web-components/tab-control/` — `mp-tab-control` (already mostly compliant; one gap on tab-panels)
- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/dock/src/lib/web-components/` — `mint-dock-manager`
- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/web-components/scheduler/` + `scheduler-core/` — `mp-scheduler`
- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/tile-manager/src/lib/web-components/` — `mint-tile-manager`
- `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/calendar/` — `bs-calendar` (Angular; APG Date Picker grid pattern). **Scope extension** added 2026-05-10 to track the calendar's missing grid roles + arrow-key navigation. Shares enough of the grid model with Phase 5 (scheduler) and Phase 3 (tile-manager) to belong with this rollout rather than be tracked separately.

**Out of scope:**

- The Angular wrapper layer for these (`bs-dock-manager`, `bs-tile-manager`, `bs-scheduler`, `bs-splitter` if it exists). Wrappers will need template tweaks only if a label/id needs to be forwarded; track those in the per-component checklists, not as a separate workstream.
- `mint-multi-range`, which already shipped with full APG slider conformance (commit `75315da`).
- `mp-tab-control`'s tab-switching keyboard model — already complete (see audit notes); only the missing tab-panel role/labelledby is in scope.

## 4. Methodology

4 parallel research agents (one per component) each reported, with file:line refs:

- Render path (WC class, render template, sub-templates, Angular wrapper)
- Current `role` / `aria-*` / `tabindex` state — static and dynamic
- Keyboard support today — what's wired, what isn't
- Gaps vs. the matching APG pattern
- Live regions / announcements
- Severity classification per concern
- Remediation outline + open questions

Findings are consolidated below by component. Cross-cutting concerns (live announcer, move-mode interaction model) are pulled out into §7.

## 5. Findings — by component

### 5.1 `mp-splitter` — **Critical**

The divider is a semantic black hole. **Zero ARIA, zero keyboard support, zero `tabindex`** on the dynamically-created `.divider` divs.

| Aspect | Current state | File:line |
|---|---|---|
| Divider role | None | `mp-splitter.ts:215–221` |
| Divider keyboard | None — pointer-only | `input/input-handler.ts:31–79` |
| `aria-orientation` | None | — |
| `aria-valuenow` / `min` / `max` | None | — |
| `aria-controls` to adjacent panels | None; panels have no IDs | `mp-splitter.ts:199–212` |
| `aria-label` | None | — |
| `tabindex="0"` on dividers | Missing | — |

**Precedent:** `BsResizeGlyphDirective` (`libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/resizable/src/lib/components/resizable.component.ts:14–17`, `247–282`, commit `94d314c5`) already implements APG Window Splitter for an Angular glyph — same role/label/orientation/keyboard. Mirror that here.

**Severity: Critical.** Splitter is invisible and inoperable to keyboard + SR users. Violates WCAG 2.1.1 (Keyboard) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).

### 5.2 `mint-dock-manager` — mixed: 1 Critical, 4 Major

The tab-switching surface is **fully accessible** (`mp-tab-control` does the heavy lifting — APG Tabs pattern complete, including roving tabindex + ArrowLeft/Right/Home/End). Everything else is broken.

| Concern | Current state | File:line |
|---|---|---|
| **Tab panels** | Missing `role="tabpanel"` + `aria-labelledby` on the content wrapper | `mp-tab-control.ts:172–178` |
| **Splitter dividers** | Inherits all of `mp-splitter`'s gaps (§5.1) | — |
| **Intersection handles** (2D split crossings) | `role="separator"` + generic `aria-label` set, but no `aria-orientation`, no `aria-valuenow/min/max`, no keyboard handler | `mint-dock-manager.element.ts:737–757` |
| **Drop joysticks** | `<button type="button">` with `aria-label="Dock to top/left/center/right/bottom"` — **good** | template lines 13–58 |
| **Floating panes** | `<div>` wrappers — no `role="dialog"`, no `aria-label`, no close button, no keyboard equivalents for any interaction | `mint-dock-manager.element.ts:534–560` |
| **Floating-pane resizers** (8 per pane) | Bare `<div>` — no role, no orientation, pointer-only | `mint-dock-manager.element.ts:583–625` |
| **Drag-to-move panes** (tab→float, dock→dock) | **Pointer-only. No keyboard alternative.** | `mint-dock-manager.element.ts:1093–1260, 1536–1558` |
| **Live region** | None. Layout changes (`dispatchLayoutChanged` at lines 1296, 1358, 1472, 1600) are silent to AT | — |

**Severity:**
- **Critical** — drag-to-move keyboard alternative (move-mode); blocks blind/keyboard-only users entirely.
- **Major** — tab-panel roles, divider keyboard/ARIA (covered by §5.1 fix to `mp-splitter`), floating-pane semantics (role + label + close button), live region for layout changes.
- **Minor** — pane-host `role="region"` + `aria-label` (only when pane content is document-like).

### 5.3 `mp-scheduler` — **Critical** across the board

The timeline is **invisible to AT** except for the header buttons. No grid roles, no event labels, no keyboard alternative to drag, no live region.

| Aspect | Current state | File:line |
|---|---|---|
| Header nav buttons (prev/next/today/view) | Native `<button>` with `title` — **partial: titles aren't always picked up; needs `aria-label`** | `mp-scheduler.ts:316–370` |
| View-switcher active state | `.active` class only — no `aria-pressed` / `aria-current` | `mp-scheduler.ts:357–364` |
| Timeline grid container | No `role="grid"`, no label | `views/timeline-view.ts:24–111` |
| Resource rows | No `role="row"`, no `aria-rowindex` | `views/timeline-view.ts:115` |
| Resource header column | No `role="rowheader"` | `views/timeline-view.ts:122–136` |
| Time-axis headers | No `role="columnheader"` | `views/timeline-view.ts:82–87` |
| Time-slot cells | No `role="gridcell"`, no `tabindex` | `views/timeline-view.ts:150–158` |
| Event blocks | Bare `<div>`. **Not focusable. No label. No role.** Text content = title only | `views/timeline-view.ts:243–289` |
| Selected-event styling | `.selected` class — no `aria-selected` / `aria-current` | — |
| Keyboard event-move | None — all drag is pointer-only | `input/input-handler.ts:113–150` |
| Live region | None | — |
| Day/view shortcuts (T/Y/M/W/D) | Wired but **undiscoverable** — no announced help text | `mp-scheduler.ts:655–704` |
| Resource-group expand/collapse | `aria-expanded` not set on group header | `views/timeline-view.ts:126–129` |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` | Not honoured for auto-pan / drag preview | `styles/scheduler.styles.ts` |

**Other views:** Same gaps in `week-view.ts`, `day-view.ts`, `month-view.ts`, `year-view.ts` — fix once in a shared helper, apply across all renderers.

**Severity: Critical** for grid roles, event labels, and DnD-keyboard-alt; **Major** for live region, view-switcher state, group `aria-expanded`; **Minor** for reduced-motion.

### 5.4 `mint-tile-manager` — partially started, 6 Major gaps

The recent commit `ca7a0c9d` ("perf(tile-manager): cache layout metrics; tighten packer hot paths; fix ARIA grid hierarchy") shipped the foundation: `role="grid"` on the container, `role="row"` wrapper, `role="gridcell"` + `tabindex="0"` on each tile, a polite live region, Space-to-enter-move-mode + arrow-keys + Shift-resize + Enter/Escape, and `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured. That's substantial — but six gaps remain.

| Aspect | Current state | File:line |
|---|---|---|
| Grid container `aria-label` | Optional consumer-provided; **no fallback** when unset | `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:141` |
| Tile grid coords | No `aria-rowindex` / `aria-colindex` / `aria-rowspan` / `aria-colspan` (despite `role="grid"`) | `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:170–203` |
| Tile keyboard hint | No `aria-describedby` to a hidden instructions string ("Space to move, Shift+arrow to resize…") | same |
| Live region role | `aria-live="polite"` only — no explicit `role="status"` | `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:150` |
| Roving tabindex | All tiles `tabindex="0"`; no Home/End/ArrowUp/Down between tiles | `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:173, 813–894` |
| Discoverability of move mode | No visual or announced cue that **Space** activates move mode on Tab-into-board | — |
| Drag-begin / drag-blocked announcements | Pointer drag emits no live message; only commit does | `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:532, 613, 689` |

**Pattern decision (resolved §10 Q1):** switch to `role="region"` with managed focus and `role="button"` on tiles. The grid hierarchy `ca7a0c9d` shipped is walked back — dynamic dimensions don't fit a static grid contract well, and the region pattern reads cleaner for a freeform tile board.

**Severity: Major** across all six.

## 6. Cross-cutting findings

### 6.1 Drag-and-drop keyboard alternative — shared interaction model

Three of four WCs (dock, scheduler, tile-manager) have pointer-only drag. The shared keymap is **`M` to enter move/resize mode**, arrow keys nudge, Enter commits, Escape cancels, live region narrates each step. Tile-manager already implements the model (it shipped using Space — Phase 3 retrofits it to `M` to align library-wide; see §10 Q2 decision). Concretely:

| Component | Trigger | Arrows | Shift+arrows | Enter | Escape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mp-splitter` divider | Focused divider (Tab) | resize ±10% | resize ±1% (fine) | (commit live; no separate "enter mode") | revert to drag-start size |
| `mint-tile-manager` tile | `M` on focused tile | move 1 cell | resize 1 cell | commit | cancel |
| `mint-dock-manager` tab/pane | `M` on focused tab header | cycle through drop targets (dock zones + floating windows) | — | commit move | cancel |
| `mp-scheduler` event block | `M` on focused event | nudge by `slotDuration` along time axis; up/down = next resource row | — | commit | revert to original time |

Splitter is the simplest (no separate "mode" — focus + arrows immediately resize, like the existing `BsResizeGlyphDirective`). Dock is the most complex (move targets are a list, not a 2D grid). Tile-manager is the precedent for the modal pattern.

### 6.2 Live announcer — share the primitive

All four WCs need a polite live region. The Angular layer already has `BsLiveAnnouncer` (per companion PRD §11). For the Lit WCs, introduce a small shared helper:

- **File:** `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/web-components/a11y/src/live-announcer.ts` (new entry point)
- **API:** `createLiveAnnouncer(host: HTMLElement): { announce(msg: string): void; dispose(): void }`
- **Implementation:** appends a visually-hidden `<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">` to the host's shadow root; debounces identical messages; clears after 1s so the same message can re-announce.

Each WC instantiates one in `connectedCallback`, disposes in `disconnectedCallback`. No service injection, no Angular DI dependency.

### 6.3 Shadow DOM and `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby`

ID references **do** cross the shadow boundary in spec, but real-world SR support is uneven. Three rules of thumb that came out of the audits:

1. **Same-tree references work everywhere.** Both ends in the same shadow root → reliable.
2. **Light → shadow references work in modern browsers** (e.g. tab header in light DOM `aria-labelledby` of a tabpanel in shadow DOM). Test with NVDA.
3. **Shadow → light references are the brittle case** (`aria-controls` from a shadow divider to a light-DOM panel). Avoid this — assign the panels stable IDs and keep the reference within shadow, or re-emit the panel into shadow as a slotted host.

For `mp-splitter`: panels are projected via named slots (`slot="panel-${index}"`). The divider lives in shadow; the panels live in light. Use a host-level data attribute (`data-panel-ids="..."`) or a public getter so dividers can resolve adjacent panel IDs without crossing the boundary in `aria-controls`.

### 6.4 `prefers-reduced-motion`

Tile-manager already honours it (template.ts:190–197). The other three don't:
- `mp-splitter` — drag preview is JS-driven, no transition; check no animation is added later
- `mint-dock-manager` — pane reflow / floating drag, no reduced-motion guards
- `mp-scheduler` — auto-pan during drag-near-edge, no guard

Single-line CSS guard in each `*.styles.ts` is enough.

## 7. Plan — phased rollout

Each phase ships as one PR. Within each phase, audits + tests land with the implementation.

### Phase 0 — Shared primitives (1 PR) — ✓ shipped (`e1e85bf3`)
- **0.1** Add `libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/web-components/a11y/` entry point with `createLiveAnnouncer()` (§6.2).
- **0.2** Document the move-mode interaction model in `docs/prd/wc-aria-accessibility.md` §6.1 (this file). Reference from each component's audit.

### Phase 1 — `mp-splitter` (1 PR) — ✓ shipped (`25ea4444`)
- **1.1** `mp-splitter.ts:215–221` divider creation: emit `role="separator"`, `aria-orientation`, `aria-label`, `tabindex="0"`. ([precedent](../../libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/resizable/src/lib/components/resizable.component.ts))
- **1.2** `mp-splitter.ts:199–212` panel wrappers: assign deterministic IDs (`{instanceId}-panel-{i}`); expose adjacent-pair IDs to dividers via a host-level data attribute (§6.3).
- **1.3** Track current/min/max sizes per divider; mirror to `aria-valuenow/min/max` as **percent of container** (§10 Q3) live during drag (subscribe `stateManager.previewSizes`, divide by container size each frame).
- **1.4** New `input-handler.ts` keydown branch — Arrow keys ±10% (Shift = ±1%), Home/End to min/max, modelled on `BsResizeGlyphDirective.onKeydown` (`resizable.component.ts:247–282`).
- **1.5** Vitest: `mp-splitter.a11y.spec.ts` — assert role/label/orientation, focus, and that ArrowLeft on horizontal-orientation shrinks left panel by 10px.

### Phase 2 — `mp-tab-control` tab-panel role (1 small PR) — ✓ shipped (`e742ba51`)
- **2.1** `mp-tab-control.ts:172–178` — bind `role="tabpanel"` + `aria-labelledby="{tabId}-header-button"` on the active content wrapper.
- **2.2** Vitest assertion in existing `mp-tab-control.spec.ts`.

### Phase 3 — `mint-tile-manager` (1 PR) — ✓ shipped (`0d2f25b1`)
Decision recorded (§10 Q1): switch from `role="grid"` to `role="region"` + `role="button"` tiles. Decision recorded (§10 Q2): retrofit move-mode key from Space to `M`.
- **3.1** `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:141` — replace `role="grid"` with `role="region"`; fallback `aria-label="Tile board"` when consumer doesn't pass `label`. Drop the `role="row"` wrapper (line 142, added in `ca7a0c9d`).
- **3.2** `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:170–203` — replace `role="gridcell"` on each tile with `role="button"`; tiles keep their consumer-provided `aria-label`. Remove host's `role="application"` set in `connectedCallback` (lines 271–274) — region pattern doesn't need it.
- **3.3** `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:150` — add `role="status"` to the live region.
- **3.4** Hidden `<div id="tile-instructions">` near the live region with the keymap text ("Press M to enter move mode. In move mode, arrow keys move, Shift+arrow resizes, Enter commits, Escape cancels."); tiles set `aria-describedby="tile-instructions"`.
- **3.5** Roving tabindex: track `focusedTileId` in element state; render only the focused tile with `tabindex="0"`, others `tabindex="-1"`. Wire ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right and Home/End in `onTileKeyDown` to move focus between tiles in row-major order **when not in move mode**. Inside move mode, arrows still control the active tile's position/size.
- **3.6** Retrofit move-mode trigger key from Space → `M` (`onTileKeyDown` at `mint-tile-manager.element.ts:813–841`). Update the live-region message at line 821 to reflect the new key. **Breaking change** — document in the changelog; per BC memory, no shim.
- **3.7** Pointer drag — call `liveAnnouncer.announce()` on drag-begin and on `blocked: true` reflow result (`element.ts:613, 689`).
- **3.8** Vitest: rewrite the role/keyboard assertions in `mint-tile-manager.element.spec.ts` for the region+button+M model.

### Phase 4 — `mint-dock-manager` non-DnD ARIA (1 PR) — ✓ shipped (`49bd9bb6` + `d8029544`)
- **4.1** Use the live announcer (Phase 0) to narrate `dispatchLayoutChanged` calls (lines 1296, 1358, 1472, 1600) — "Pane X moved to dock {zone}", "Floating pane X closed", "Split resized".
- **4.2** Floating pane wrapper (`element.ts:534–550`): `role="dialog"`, `aria-label` from `getFloatingWindowTitle()`, `aria-modal="false"`.
- **4.3** Add a real close button to `.dock-floating__chrome` (`element.ts:551–560`): `<button aria-label="Close pane: {title}">×</button>`. Native button = native keyboard.
- **4.4** Floating-pane resizers (`element.ts:583–625`): `role="separator"` + `aria-orientation` per side.
- **4.5** Intersection handles (`element.ts:737–757`) — extend role/label that already exist with `aria-orientation` (the cross-handle is bidirectional; emit `"horizontal"` or split into two co-located handles, one per axis).
- **4.6** Vitest: `mint-dock-manager.a11y.spec.ts` assertions for tab-panel role, floating dialog role, close button, live announcements.
- **NB.** Splitter ARIA on the dock's nested `<mp-splitter>` lands automatically with Phase 1; Phase 4 inherits it.

### Phase 5 — `mp-scheduler` grid + labels (1 PR) — ✓ shipped (`a13952e7`)
- **5.1** Grid roles in `views/timeline-view.ts`: `role="grid"` + `aria-label` + `aria-rowcount` + `aria-colcount` on `.scheduler-timeline` (line 32); `role="row"` + `aria-rowindex` on resource rows (line 115); `role="rowheader"` on resource header (line 122); `role="columnheader"` on slot headers (line 82); `role="gridcell"` + `tabindex="-1"` on slots (line 150).
- **5.2** Event blocks (`views/timeline-view.ts:243–289`): `role="button"`, descriptive `aria-label` (`"{title}, {start}–{end} on {resource}, {date}"`), roving `tabindex` (selected event = 0, others = -1), `aria-current="true"` when selected.
- **5.3** Header view-switcher (`mp-scheduler.ts:357–364`): `aria-pressed="{active}"` on each view button.
- **5.4** Resource-group toggles (`views/timeline-view.ts:126–129`): wrap header in `<button>` with `aria-expanded`.
- **5.5** Live announcer for `event-update`/`event-create`/`event-delete`/`view-change` (`scheduler-event-emitter.ts:7–97`).
- **5.6** `prefers-reduced-motion` guard in `scheduler.styles.ts` for auto-pan.
- **5.7** Mirror the same role/label set in `views/{week,day,month,year}-view.ts`. Hoist the labelling helper to `views/base-view.ts` or a new `views/aria.ts`.
- **5.8** Vitest: `mp-scheduler.a11y.spec.ts` — assert grid roles, event labels, view-switcher pressed state.

### Phase 6 — `mp-scheduler` keyboard event-move (1 PR, separate from Phase 5) — ✓ shipped + extended (`614fb0fe` → `9ae72107`)

**Note:** v1 (M-key + arrow nudge, items 6.3–6.6 below) shipped in `614fb0fe`. The originally out-of-scope items (6.7 — resize and multi-day) plus full cell-level grid navigation (item 6.1) shipped as a separate follow-up PRD: [`scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md`](./scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md), commit `9ae72107`. That PRD is the canonical reference for the scheduler keyboard model going forward; the steps below are kept as the historical v1 plan.

The follow-up changed:
- Move-mode entry key: `M` → `Enter` (breaking change documented in CHANGELOG).
- Bare letter shortcuts `T`/`Y`/`M`/`W`/`D` → `Alt+T`/`Alt+Y`/`Alt+M`/`Alt+W`/`Alt+D` (frees single letters for future input surfaces inside the scheduler).
- Bare `ArrowLeft`/`Right` no longer change period — they walk cells; use `PageUp`/`PageDown` for prev/next period.
- Roving tabindex on events → every event is `tabindex="0"` (Tab walks events in document order).
- `event-click` custom event → `event-selected` (fires on Tab too).

- **6.1** Roving focus across grid cells: only one cell `tabindex="0"`; `mp-scheduler.ts:655–704` `handleKeyDown` handles ArrowLeft/Right/Up/Down between cells, Home/End row edges, Ctrl+Home/End grid edges. Reuse the cell-grid focus model in `mint-tile-manager` Phase 3 if it generalises.
- **6.2** Tab into board lands on first cell (or selected event if any).
- **6.3** `M` on focused event → enter move mode (set `data-move-mode` on event, announce keymap).
- **6.4** ArrowLeft/Right while in move mode → call `dragManager.nudgeEventTime(±slotDuration)`; live region announces new start time (verbose first nudge, terse afterwards).
- **6.5** Enter → commit via existing `handleDragComplete()` path (`mp-scheduler.ts:576–593`).
- **6.6** Escape → revert via existing drag-cancel path.
- **6.7** Resize and multi-day are out of scope for v1 (per audit recommendation Q4); document as v2 follow-ups. **Resolved by `scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md`:** Shift+Arrow resizes the end edge, Alt+Shift the start edge, week-view Shift+ArrowLeft/Right resizes across day boundaries.
- **6.8** Vitest: extend `mp-scheduler.a11y.spec.ts`. **Plus** `mp-scheduler.keyboard.spec.ts` covering the extended model (12 cases).

### Phase 7 — `mint-dock-manager` move-mode for panes (1 PR, biggest) — ✓ shipped (`32ca12b7`)

Implementation deviation from the audit-time plan: instead of "arrow keys cycle the move-target list" (7.2), the shipped keymap uses direct-letter commits (`T`/`R`/`B`/`L` to dock, `F` to float). Faster for repeat use; the live region still narrates entry + commit.

- **7.1** Move-target enumeration: build the list of valid drop destinations (dock zones × stacks + each floating window). Hoist from the pointer drop-zone code (`element.ts:1223–1260`) so the same model serves both inputs.
- **7.2** Tab-header keymap: focused tab → `M` → enter move mode → arrow keys cycle the move-target list → live region narrates current target. **Shipped variant:** `T`/`R`/`B`/`L` commits to dock zones, `F` floats.
- **7.3** Enter commits via existing pane-move pipeline; Escape cancels. **Shipped variant:** the letter keys above commit; `Escape` still cancels.
- **7.4** Cross-cutting: pressing Escape during *any* drag (pointer or keyboard) cancels and announces.
- **7.5** Vitest + a Playwright smoke spec in `apps/ng-bootstrap-demo-e2e/` for the move-mode happy path. **Done.** Vitest in `mint-dock-manager.aria.spec.ts`; Playwright in `apps/ng-bootstrap-demo-e2e/e2e/dock-keyboard.spec.ts` (3 cases × Chromium + Firefox: M→T commit, M→Escape cancel, M-no-op-when-blurred). Writing the e2e exposed and fixed a real bug in `findFocusedPaneOrigin` — the lookup didn't account for mp-tab-control's `${tabId}-header-button` id suffix, so move-mode entry was silently broken in production. Unit tests injected `paneMoveMode` directly and missed it.

### Phase 8 — Polish (1 PR) — ✓ items 8.1 + 8.3 shipped (`332d2d4f` + various); 8.2 deferred
- **8.1** `prefers-reduced-motion` guards across splitter, dock, and scheduler. **Done** — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` blocks added at the foot of each component's SCSS, neutralising `transition` and `animation` declarations. Tile-manager already had its guard from `ca7a0c9d`.
- **8.2** `axe-core/playwright` run on the dock, scheduler, and tile-manager demo pages; capture baseline; fail CI on `critical`/`serious`. **Deferred to follow-up PR** — adds a new dev-dep (`@axe-core/playwright`), CI job, and baseline-snapshot review process, and is genuinely separable from the per-component implementation work this PRD covers. Tracking issue to be opened post-merge.
- **8.3** Surface the keymap on the demo pages — this is part of the deliverable, not a nice-to-have. **Done** — visible `<details>Keyboard shortcuts</details>` panels live on each of `splitter`, `dock`, `tile-manager`, `calendar`, and `scheduler` demo pages. Each affected demo page (`apps/ng-bootstrap-demo/src/app/pages/advanced/{dock,tile-manager}/`, scheduler equivalent, splitter equivalent) gets a visible "Keyboard shortcuts" panel listing the keys for that component, e.g.:
  - **`M`** — enter move/resize mode (tile-manager, dock pane, scheduler event)
  - **Arrow keys** — move 1 unit (or resize with Shift) while in move mode; navigate between focused items otherwise
  - **Enter** — commit the move/resize
  - **Escape** — cancel and revert
  - **Tab / Shift+Tab** — move focus between tiles / events / panes / dividers
  - **Home / End** — first / last in row (grid components) or min / max (splitter)

  The keymap is also exposed in-component via the `aria-describedby` instructions string (see Phase 3.4, Phase 5.x, Phase 7.2), so SR users get the same content. The visible panel covers sighted keyboard users who don't read SR text.

### Phase 9 — `bs-calendar` grid + keyboard navigation (1 PR — Angular, scope extension) — ✓ shipped (`4d442375`)

**Scope note.** `bs-calendar` is an Angular component, not a Lit WC. It's tracked here because the calendar / datepicker grid pattern shares the same APG Grid model the scheduler (Phase 5) and tile-manager (Phase 3) deal with, and the user-facing gap (calendar body unreachable by keyboard) was found while iterating on this PRD. Originally listed as Critical in `docs/prd/aria-accessibility-audit.md` §5.1; partially resolved by `4d6a3a5f` (`aria-selected` / `aria-current="date"` / `aria-disabled`) but the keyboard model was not.

**Current state** (`libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/calendar/src/calendar.component.html`):
- ✓ `aria-selected` / `aria-current="date"` / `aria-disabled` on day cells
- ✓ Prev/next nav buttons labelled; polite live region on month title
- ✓ `<th scope="col"|"row">` headers
- ✗ No `role="grid"` on the table; no `role="gridcell"` / `role="row"` / `role="columnheader"` / `role="rowheader"`
- ✗ Day cells have no `tabindex` — **calendar body is not reachable via keyboard at all**
- ✗ No arrow-key / Home / End / PageUp / PageDown navigation

**Target pattern.** WAI-ARIA APG [Date Picker Dialog](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) — calendar table is a `role="grid"` with one tab stop into the body, then 2D arrow-key navigation between dates. Keymap:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Tab | Prev-button → calendar body (one stop) → Next-button |
| ArrowLeft / ArrowRight | Previous / next day |
| ArrowUp / ArrowDown | Previous / next week |
| Home / End | First / last day of the focused week |
| PageUp / PageDown | Previous / next month |
| Ctrl+PageUp / Ctrl+PageDown | Previous / next year |
| Enter / Space | Select the focused date |

**Implementation outline.**

- **9.1** Calendar table: add `role="grid"` + `aria-labelledby` to the month-title cell so SR users hear the focused month/year as the grid's accessible name.
- **9.2** Replace bare `<tr>` / `<th>` / `<td>` with role attributes — `role="row"` on each row, `role="columnheader"` on weekday headers (already use `<th scope="col">`, just add the role), `role="rowheader"` on week-number cells, `role="gridcell"` on day cells.
- **9.3** Roving tabindex on day cells: a single signal-backed `focusedDate` field (defaults to `selectedDate ?? today ?? firstEnabledOfMonth`); template binds `[attr.tabindex]` to `0` for that cell, `-1` for all others. Per the memory rule, derive in a `computed()`, not inline.
- **9.4** Keyboard handler on the calendar host (or on each cell) implementing the keymap above. Movement that crosses month boundaries triggers the existing `previousMonth()` / `nextMonth()` methods + advances `focusedDate` accordingly. `disableDateFn` is honoured — disabled cells are skipped during arrow nav (or focus lands on them but Enter is a no-op; APG accepts either; pick "skip" for parity with `BsRovingFocusItem`).
- **9.5** After a keyboard month change, focus the corresponding cell in the new month (Angular `viewChildren` query on cells, or focus by `[id]="dateId"` lookup).
- **9.6** Visible focus ring on the focused cell (today's `:focus` styling — confirm `:focus-visible` works on `<td>`; if not, paint via the cell's class-bound state).
- **9.7** Remove the fallback `aria-label="Calendar"` on the table and replace with month/year derived label so SR users know which calendar they're in.
- **9.8** Datepicker (`libs/mintplayer-ng-bootstrap/datepicker/`) inherits all of this for free since it embeds `bs-calendar`. Confirm: trigger button still has `aria-haspopup="dialog"` + `aria-expanded` (separate gap tracked in the Angular PRD §5.2).
- **9.9** Vitest: `calendar.aria.spec.ts` — assert grid roles, roving tabindex, ArrowRight moves focus to next day, ArrowDown moves focus to same weekday next week, PageDown advances the month, Home moves to first day of focused week, Enter selects.
- **9.10** Demo page (`apps/ng-bootstrap-demo/src/app/pages/.../calendar/...`): add a `<details>Keyboard shortcuts</details>` panel mirroring Phase 8.3.

**Severity: Critical** — calendar is operable to mouse users but completely unreachable to keyboard users. Already flagged Critical in the Angular PRD; this phase is the implementation.

## 8. Severity matrix

| Component | Critical | Major | Minor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mp-splitter` | role/label/keyboard on dividers | — | reduced-motion when transitions land |
| `mp-tab-control` | — | tab-panel role + labelledby | — |
| `mint-dock-manager` | DnD keyboard alternative (panes) | tab-panel inherits; floating-pane semantics; live region; intersection-handle valuenow | pane-host region label |
| `mp-scheduler` | grid roles; event labels + focusability; DnD keyboard alternative (events) | live region; view-switcher pressed; group expanded | reduced-motion auto-pan |
| `mint-tile-manager` | — | grid coord attrs; instructions describedby; live-region role; roving tabindex; move-mode discoverability; drag-begin announcements | role-choice settled |
| `bs-calendar` (Angular) | calendar body unreachable by keyboard; no grid roles; no arrow-key / Home/End / PageUp/Down nav | — | focus ring on focused cell |

## 9. Test strategy

Mirroring the companion PRD §7:

- **Unit (Vitest 4)** — per-component `*.a11y.spec.ts` next to existing specs. Assert the *exact* attribute set after `connectedCallback` + after each user interaction. Positive presence, not just "no axe violations".
- **Integration (Vitest, jsdom)** — fire keyboard events, assert state transitions (move mode in → arrow → commit → out) and live-region content.
- **E2E (Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright`)** — extend the existing `apps/ng-bootstrap-demo-e2e/` specs for dock, scheduler, tile-manager, splitter demo pages. Fail on `critical`/`serious` violations.
- **Manual SR pass** — NVDA/Firefox + JAWS/Chrome on Windows, VoiceOver/Safari on macOS, once per phase. Documented in PR descriptions.

## 10. Open questions

All seven resolved 2026-05-10 ahead of implementation.

1. **Tile-manager: `role="grid"` vs. `role="region"`?**
   - **Decision: `role="region"`.** Walk back the grid hierarchy `ca7a0c9d` shipped. Tiles become `role="button"`; the row wrapper and `role="application"` are dropped. Cleaner for a dynamic, freeform layout where grid dimensions drift under user interaction.

2. **Dock move-mode trigger key — Space, `M`, or `Enter`?**
   - **Decision: `M`.** Mnemonic for "move", aligns with APG examples. Tile-manager (which shipped using Space in `ca7a0c9d`) is retrofitted to `M` in Phase 3 step 3.6 — breaking change, no shim. `M` is the single library-wide trigger across tile-manager, dock, scheduler.

3. **Splitter `aria-valuenow` in pixels or percent?**
   - **Decision: percent of container.** More intuitive for SR users ("50%"); arrow steps are 10% (Shift = 1%). Conversion happens once per drag-preview frame — negligible cost.

4. **Scheduler keyboard nudge granularity?**
   - **Decision: `options.slotDuration`.** Matches the visual snap users learn from drag. Already exposed at `mp-scheduler.ts:156–159`.

5. **Scheduler full grid vs. region+buttons?**
   - **Decision: full `role="grid"`.** Worth the ~200 LOC cost for the AT experience on a complex widget.

6. **Move-mode in the WC or the Angular wrapper?**
   - **Decision: Lit WC.** Keymap lives where the DOM lives. Wrappers stay thin. Layout-change reactions flow through CustomEvents.

7. **Cross-shadow `aria-controls` reliability** (§6.3).
   - **Decision: auto-generate panel IDs internally.** `mp-splitter` assigns deterministic IDs (`{instanceId}-panel-{i}`) to its slot wrappers and exposes the divider→panel adjacency via a host-level data attribute. Zero consumer burden.

## 11. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Move-mode keymap collides with consumer keyboard handlers | All keys handled in capture phase only when focus is on a controlled element (tile/event/tab). Browser default actions explicitly preventDefault'd only when a mode is active. |
| Roving tabindex breaks existing consumers relying on every tile/event being individually tab-focusable | Document as a breaking change in the PR; add a `legacyTabindex` opt-out only if a consumer raises it. (Memory: BC is not a default constraint.) |
| Live region spam during fast drag | Debounce at the announcer (200ms tail-coalesce); skip if consecutive messages are equal. |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` regression on already-shipped tile-manager | Existing CSS branch covers it; new code lands in CSS, not JS, so the existing guard applies. |
| SR support for cross-shadow `aria-labelledby` | Restrict to same-tree references (§6.3) when ambiguous; verify in NVDA + JAWS pass before each phase merges. |

## 12. Out-of-scope follow-ups (not blocking this PRD)

### Shipped follow-ups (2026-05-10)

These items were originally listed as v2 / deferred but landed during the rollout:

- ~~Scheduler keyboard event-resize (audit Q4) — v2.~~ Shipped in `9ae72107` (`scheduler-keyboard-grid-nav.md` §6.6): in move-mode, `Shift+Arrow` resizes the end edge, `Alt+Shift+Arrow` resizes the start edge.
- ~~Scheduler multi-day event keyboard model — v2.~~ Shipped in `9ae72107` (D5): on week view, `Shift+ArrowLeft/Right` in move-mode pushes the end edge across day boundaries; `Shift+Arrow` extension during cell selection forms linear ranges that cross day boundaries.
- ~~Tile-manager resize animation.~~ Shipped 2026-05-11 by option (b): during a pointer-resize gesture, `renderTile` (`mint-tile-manager.element.ts:178–202`) inlines `width: <colSpan*cellW + gapX>px; height: <rowSpan*cellH + gapY>px` on the active tile, computed from the cached `cellMetrics`. The `data-resizing="true"` SCSS rule (`mint-tile-manager.element.scss:45–50`) switched from `transition: none` to `transition: width 150ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1), height 150ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`, so the visible size lerps between span states instead of snapping. The grid still owns layout — siblings reflow through the existing FLIP animator (it still skips the active tile, but no longer needs to handle it). Reduced-motion is preserved by the global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { .tile { transition: none !important; } }` rule. Inline width/height clear on commit when `data-resizing` flips back to false. Browser-verified: height ramps 690 → 800px over the 150ms window with cubic-bezier easing.

### Still deferred

- Dock floating-pane modal trapping for "keep focus inside" — only if consumer demand surfaces.
- A shared `@mintplayer/wc-a11y` package extracted from §6.2's helper — defer until a third WC consumer appears.
- `@axe-core/playwright` CI integration (Phase 8.2) — tracking issue to be opened post-merge.
