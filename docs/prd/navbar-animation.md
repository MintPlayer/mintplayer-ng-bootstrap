# Navbar animation problem
## Current behavior
In small mode (on small browser windows), initially the navbar toggle animation works fine.
But when the window resizes in height, opening/closing the navbar doesn't animate the height anymore.

## Expected behavior
In small mode, the navbar toggle animation should always work.
